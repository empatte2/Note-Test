# Note_Test

 test your pitch

I decided to re-do an old project of mine from high school that generates a sine wave a frequency corresponging to a random musical note.
The program then asks the user what that note was and the user has to guess the note, if they are correct, they'll get a point. This is
essentially just a perfect pitch game. 

It was originally quite poorly written. I decided to completely do it again, this time implementing my better understanding of how 
programming languages work and also to try and practice my python skillset. 

In this repository I have included the old file for reference and shame as well as a list of some planned updates should the desire ever
come that I want to get some more practice in and make the game a bit more expansive.
